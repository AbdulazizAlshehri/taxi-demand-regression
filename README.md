# taxi-demand-regression
This is a MapReduce program that uses ST-Hadoop in querying spatial-temporal taxi data at a specific area in a specific time interval to predict taxi demand in NYC.

# Prerequisites
In order to run taxi demand regression, you need to have at least **Java 1.8**, Hadoop installed and running, we used **Hadoop 2.9** but any **Hadoop 2.x** should work fine, in case you need to download and compile [ST-Hadoop](https://github.com/lmarabi/st-hadoop) on your own machine then we suggest to have **Maven 3.6** installed for compiling and assembling, otherwise, you can use pre-compiled `sthadoop-2.4.1-SNAPSHOT-uber.jar` directly.
